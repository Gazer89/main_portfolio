                <p>I started coding because I know that it is the wave of the future. What I did not know, is that I would actually come to love it as much as I do today. I cannot wait for it to be my day job. I have a lot of experience with writing requirements and launching applications to users. Now I will be able to not only help with requirements but also development. I think one of the things I love so much about coding is that I will be able to continue learning and creating for the rest of my life. There will always be a new mountain to climb. </p>
                
                <p>Interesting fact about myself, I am a black belt in Shorin-ryu karate. I plan to use my new-found knowledge to update their website and create a mobile app for my school. Karate has taught me a lot about passing on knowledge and how powerful working with others can be. I love hiking and being in nature. It reminds me how magnificent this world is and allows me to remind myself how blessed I am. I love fishing and camping. It nice to disconnect and recharge. </p>
